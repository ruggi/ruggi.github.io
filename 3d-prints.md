# 3D Prints

This is a collection of useful 3D prints I use and some other useful things for future reference.

## Models

* [Hex drawer box](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:421886): a neat desk drawer, I have a couple in different sizes where I keep a bunch of different tools and parts for my hobbies.
* [Simple phone stand](https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/19811-simple-phone-stand): a versatile phone stand (supports both portrait and landscape orientations), very quick to print.
