# Deploying md on GitHub pages

I spent the last couple days building [md](https://github.com/ruggi/md), a minimal Markdown static site generator.

This site is generated by `md`, and it's deployed on GitHub Pages using a simple GitHub Action:

```yaml
name: build

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-18.04
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Install Go
        uses: actions/setup-go@v2
        with:
          go-version: "^1.16.2"

      - name: Install md
        run: go get github.com/ruggi/md

      - name: Build
        run: md build

      - name: Deploy
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
        with:
          github_token: ${{ `{{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` }}
          publish_dir: ./.md/out
```

## Steps

The steps are pretty simple:

1. Install Go via `actions/setup-go@v2`
2. Install md via `go get`
3. Build the local folder
4. Deploy with `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages`

## Repo config

Once the action runs, it will publish the output folder (`./.md/out`) on the `gh-pages` branch. You can set that to be the target for the deployment in the `Pages` section of the repository's settings:
